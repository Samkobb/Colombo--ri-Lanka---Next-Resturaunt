    "Sri Lanka known as the <i>Pearl of the Indian Ocean </i> is a popular tourist destination. With spectacular sites to visit and great natural beauty it has been judged as the #1 place to visit for multiple years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sri Lanka also has a very vibrant food scene. It has its own unique flavours and food culture. Apart from this there are many international chains plus food trends that have spread across the country to cater to all the tourists and changing demographic of local taste buds. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Problem </h3>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "The lack of insight into proper data causes many resturaunts to open and close frequently due to lack of revenue and improper location selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will analyse the spread of resturaunts across the Colombo specifically (The capital of Sri Lanka), to identify possible locations we can open up a new restarunt. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will help new restraunt owners entrepreneurs and local / internationl food chains decide on the possible place they should open the new resturaunt and what type of a restauraunt will be best suitable."
